# garden_rover

garden rover lives in a mini terrarium which contains nearly all of life's delights -- a koi pond, a bridge, a levitating rock, some plants and flowers, a picnic spot, a favorite tree. 

garden rover's daily routine is to take a nap under her tree, fill some water from the koi pond, and gently mist all the plants she sees along the way.
